# [449.Serialize and Deserialize BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-bst/)
Difficulty:Medium, Likes: 456

## Description

<p>Serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.</p>

<p>Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a <b>binary search tree</b>. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.</p>

<p><b>The encoded string should be as compact as possible.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> root = [2,1,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> [2,1,3]
</pre><p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> root = []
<strong>Output:</strong> []
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[0, 10<sup>4</sup>]</code>.</li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li>The input tree is <strong>guaranteed</strong> to be a binary search tree.</li>
</ul>
